Something's tearing me down and down
And I can't help but feel it's coming from you
She's a gunshot bride as the trigger cries
I just wonder what we've gotten ourselves into
In a trail of fire I know we will be free again
In the end we will be one
In a trail of fire I'll burn before you bury me
Set your sights for the sun
Mind is willing, soul remains
This woman cannot be saved
From the draw into the fire
Mind is willing, soul remains
This woman cannot be saved
From the draw into the fire
Anything to bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Much to weak to jump yourself
Heal the wounds or crack the shell
Lift yourself from once below
Much to weak to jump yourself
Heal the wounds or crack the shell
Lift yourself from once below
Praise the anger bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it on home
In a trail of fire I know we will be free again
In the end we will be one
In a trail of fire I'll burn before you bury me
Set your sights for the sun
Bring it on home
